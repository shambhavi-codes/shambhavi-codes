Hey there! I'm Shambhavi Chaturvedi 👋

I’m a Media Analyst who loves digging into data to find cool stories and real business impact.
Right now, I work at a marketing research firm, modeling media performance and helping brands understand what actually drives sales.

Big fan of all things ads, analytics, and optimization – especially when it comes to Google Ads, Amazon Ads, and YouTube campaigns.

🛠️ Languages & Tools I use a lot: Python, R, SQL, Excel, Tableau, Power BI

🌱 Always learning something new (usually related to data... or food).

🎯 Currently working toward landing a role where data meets innovation.

📍Here for side projects, experiments, and maybe a few messy-but-fun notebooks.
